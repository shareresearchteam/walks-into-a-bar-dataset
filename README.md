Data for the ICRA 2021 paper "A Robot Walks into a Bar: Automatic Robot Joke Success Assessment"

The zip folder includes a folder for each performance (1-23). Each folder houses one audio file per post-joke response; the joke numbering here is 0-indexed based on the order in which jokes were performed.

The csv file includes human labels for each of the 620 performed jokes considered in our paper. The first two columns here are a "PerformanceId" tracking the performance during which the joke was performed and a "JokeID" noting what joke led to that row's audience response.
